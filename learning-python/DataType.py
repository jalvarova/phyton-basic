#                 long(52057361L - 5434362786565L)
#                 float(1.2 - 0.56 - 32.3+e18)
#                 complex (3.14j)
#
# String  --->     String are identified  as a contiguous set of characters
#                 represented in single or double quotation marks.
#

#
#                 list =['Ghulam', 309, 3.56,4000]
#
# tuples  --->    A tuples contains values separated by commas. Tuples
#                 are enclosed within parentheses(). tuples cannot be
#                 updated. It in just read-only.

#                 tuple =('Ghulam', 309, 3.56,4000)

# dictionary    --->     Dictionary works keys and values.A dictionary key can
#                        of any type, but are usually numbers of string. Dictionaries
#                        are enclosed by {} and itÂ´s values can be accessed or assigned
#                        through [].
#
#                        dtc = {'age',:18}
